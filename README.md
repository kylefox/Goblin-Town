Goblin Town - a TextMate theme
==============================

Here's what it looks like:

![Goblin Town](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/780754/screenshot.png "Goblin Town")

Ruby code is shown, but I also use it with Python, Django, JavaScript, HTML & CSS, haml, etc.  Most languages seem to look good.

Font
----

The font is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxi_(fonts)">Luxi Mono</a> (shown at 16pt), and it's included in the zip file.

Name
----

The name "Goblin Town" is taken from the awesomest track on Mux Mool's [Viking Funeral EP](http://ghostly.com/releases/viking-funeral)
